# Week 1 Assignments
This week you'll apply concepts related to setting up your environment. From installing Rust, to using GitHub Copilot and configuring your text editor with Codespaces. These assignments are designed to help you get comfortable with the tools you'll be using throughout the course.

## Assignment 1: Install Rust with Visual Studio Code
In this assignment, you'll install Rust and configure Visual Studio Code with the Rust Analyzer extension.

### Steps
1. Install Rust using the [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) installer.
2. [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
3. Install the [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) extension for Visual Studio Code.

### Artifacts
Because this is a configuration-only assignment, there are no artifacts to submit. At the end of this assignment you should have a working Rust installation and Visual Studio Code configured with the Rust Analyzer extension.

## Assignment 2: Enable GitHub Copilot
In this assignment, you'll enable GitHub Copilot for your GitHub account. You'll also install the GitHub Copilot extension for Visual Studio Code.

### Steps
1. [Sign up for GitHub Copilot](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/step-by-step-setting-up-github-student-and-github-copilot-as-an/ba-p/3736279?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza)
2. Install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) extension for Visual Studio Code.

### Artifacts
For this assignment, you'll have a GitHub repository with a single `main.rs` file that you'll create with a single function produced with the help of GitHub Copilot. Additionally, you'll include a `README.md` that describes the function and at least one aspect of Copilot that you found interesting.

## Assignment 3: Configure Visual Studio Code with Codespaces
This is the last assignment for this week. In this assignment, you'll configure [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-alfredodeza) with [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). 

### Steps
1. Use Visual Studio Code to create a new Codespace configuration with dev containers.
2. Use the Rust image for the configuration
3. Add the Rust Analyzer and GitHub Copilot extensions to the configuration.

### Artifacts
1. A GitHub repository with a `.devcontainer` directory with the configuration files for your Codespace.
2. A `README.md` file that describes the configuration and how to use it.
3. The repository has to be fully functional with Codespaces and you should be able to run it from the browser.
